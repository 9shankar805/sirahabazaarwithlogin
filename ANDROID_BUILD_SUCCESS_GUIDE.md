# Android Studio Build Success Guide

## âœ… Problem Identified and Fixed

The Android Studio build was failing due to **missing Android SDK**. I've fixed the configuration issues:

### ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied:
1. **Gradle version compatibility** - Downgraded to work with Java 11
2. **Firebase dependencies** - Added proper BOM and libraries  
3. **Resource files** - Created notification icons and colors
4. **Build configuration** - Added gradle.properties with memory settings
5. **Android SDK setup** - Created local.properties file

### ðŸŽ¯ Android Studio Build Steps

#### Method 1: Let Android Studio Handle SDK (Recommended)
1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **File > Open** - Select your `android/` folder  
3. **When prompted about missing SDK:**
   - Click "Install missing SDK components"
   - Let Android Studio download SDK automatically
4. **Wait for Gradle sync** (5-10 minutes first time)
5. **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**

#### Method 2: Manual SDK Setup
If Android Studio doesn't auto-install SDK:
1. **Tools > SDK Manager** in Android Studio
2. **Install Android SDK** (API level 33 recommended)
3. **Update local.properties** with actual SDK path
4. **Sync and build**

### ðŸš€ Alternative: Online APK Builder

#### Option A: AppMaker (Easiest)

5. Download APK

#### Option B: PWABuilder (Microsoft)
1. Go to: https://pwabuilder.com
2. Enter your website URL
