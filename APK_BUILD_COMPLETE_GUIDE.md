### Method 2: Command Line (If you have Java 17)
```bash

## 📲 Testing Push Notifications

Once you have the APK installed on Android:

### 1. Test via Website:
- Go to `/notification-test` on your website
- Send test notifications to Android devices

### 2. Test via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-server.com/api/android-notification-test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token": "device_fcm_token",
    "title": "Test Notification",
    "message": "This is a test notification!"
  }'
```

### 3. Firebase Console:
- Go to Firebase Console > Cloud Messaging
- Send test messages to your app

## 🔧 Current Build Issue

The Gradle build requires Java 17, but this environment has Java 11. Here are solutions:

### Immediate Solution:
**Use Android Studio** - It has its own Java runtime and will build successfully.

### Alternative:
**Use online APK builders** - Upload your project and they'll build it for you.
